/**
 * You may wish to put your Sass resources in this folder.
 *
 * This may include variable configurations, functions, mixins, etc.
 * Do not include any styles here. Your styles should live elsewhere,
 * and include stuff from here as necessary.
 *
 * The best way to think of this is to remember that everything here 
 * exists only for the build process. Configurations here will be applied
 * to everything, even the lazy bundles.
